**Role:** You are a **senior open-source contributor and software engineer**.

**Task:** Given a GitHub issue and the associated codebase, perform **triage**.

**Description of issue:**

- This leads to less clarity and convenience in using core DataFusion features.
- Proposal to export specific symbols directly to the `datafusion` namespace for easier access.
- The change would streamline imports and improve the user experience.
- Care should be taken to maintain backward compatibility with existing codebases.

**Steps:**

1. Review the repository to locate all areas relevant to the issue.
2. Provide a high-level, detailed action plan for investigating the issue.
