**Role:** You are a **senior open-source contributor and software engineer**.

**Task:** Given a GitHub issue and the associated codebase, perform **triage**.

## Issue Description
${summary}

---

### 1. Understand the Issue

* Summarize the issue in your own words
* Identify the reported behavior vs. expected behavior.
* Note whether reproduction steps are provided or need to be inferred.

---

### 2. Codebase Review

* Locate **all files, modules, or components** that may relate to the issue.
* Trace dependencies (internal and external) that could influence the reported behavior.
* Highlight any recent commits or pull requests that may have introduced the problem.

---

### 3. Classification

Assign one or more categories with justification, e.g.:

* **Type:** Bug üêõ / Feature Request ‚ú® / Enhancement ‚ö° / Documentation üìñ
* **Severity:** Critical üö® / Major üî¥ / Minor üü° / Trivial ‚ö™
* **Scope:** Single-module / Multi-module / System-wide
* **Priority:** High / Medium / Low (based on user impact and reproducibility)

---

### 4. Resolution Plan

Provide a **detailed tasks** to resolve the issue

---

### 5. Next Steps

* Decide whether to:

  * Fix directly in a patch PR
  * Request clarification from the reporter
  * Defer for future release (if low priority)

---

### 6. Fix location: local vs upstream

When triaging, determine whether the corrective change should be made in this repository or in an upstream dependency/repository. Use the checklist below and record the decision in the issue.

- Is the faulty code present in this repo's source files or tests? If yes, prefer a local patch (this repo).
- Is the observed behavior caused by an external package, API, or third-party service (check imports, dependency versions, stack traces)? If yes, the fix likely belongs upstream.
- Can the issue be worked around locally (shim, patch, compatibility layer) without breaking semantics? If a safe workaround is possible and urgent, implement locally and open an upstream issue/PR.
- Is the bug reproducible with a minimal example using only the upstream project? If so, open the issue upstream and reference it here; include the reproduction steps.
- Does the repository maintain a fork or vendor copy of the upstream code? If yes, follow the repo's policy: either patch the vendored code here and submit the same patch upstream, or prefer upstream-first when feasible.

Record the conclusion as one of:

- "Fix in this repo" ‚Äî include the files and a short change summary.
- "Requires upstream fix" ‚Äî include upstream repo URL, issue/PR link if opened, and a short rationale.
- "Local workaround + upstream report" ‚Äî link the local workaround PR and the upstream issue/PR.

## Guidelines

* Do **not** generate code.
* Keep commentary **concise, structured, and strategic**.
* Focus on **analysis and solution direction**, not implementation details.
* Ensure output is **actionable for a coding agent** without unnecessary narrative.

---

‚ú® **End Goal:** Produce a clear roadmap of **tasks** for maintainers/contributors to either resolve or reclassify the issue efficiently, without ambiguity.
